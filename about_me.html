            <a1>
                <img class="wrap" src="assets/images/linkedin-headshot.png" width="130" height="130"> Originally from the East Coast, I've lived in Metro DC, Manhttan, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Seattle, Boulder,              Denver; and in Florence Italy. In 2014 I finished an Associate of Science of Business Management and Leadership
                with a concentration in Entrepreneurship. That same year, my spectacular daughter was born.
                <br>
                <br> I love what I do for work. I don't get most jokes. You can find me snowboarding every free weekend day that
                I have. Often I just get the urge to travel so I go hop on a last minute flight somewhere. I don't really
                play games, although I got into Steep recently. I grew up playing Baldur's Gate. My childhood home was a
                pink-brick, French-rooved haven with seven gardens in the yard and the Catoctin Creek flowing through the
                Blue Ridge Mountains out back. Those summer nights sleeping down in the woods, with olfactory senses engrossed
                in the scents of grasses and insects; some nights darker than our eyes can define, some nights the sky shone
                brighter than would a million lightning bugs above me. And that, is why I write poetry.
